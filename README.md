# Cooling-Module-Game
A Unity game project 

This is a mini game that represents the cooling system of a PC. It is part of a bigger system with other computer components as mini games, but this video shows only the fuctionality of the cooling system isolated.
The game and all assets are done by me except:
- Player (Model, Anims, Movement)
- Music: Benjamin TISSOT bensound.com
- SoundFX: soundbible.com
